# Red Tracker  

This is the Red Tracker android application. It is part of the Red package.  

The reason behind the random commit messages. In work environments we use conventional commits to increase commit comprehension. For this exploratory project, I am doing this to obfuscate the changes and their results. The importance of this repository is to showcase results not to teach.  

The reason behind the code bad smells like commented code and debug statements. It dont't want to have the code production ready at this point in time. This is what would usually end up in a secondary branch and then in master.

Development tools:

- Android Data Binding
- Retrofit
- RxJava
